# Terminal Talk

Terminal Talk is in its very early stages of development.

It essentially aims to be a "repeater" sitting between your terminal and favorite social media application(s). This would allow you to chat with friends - directly and within groups - right within your terminal! Yes, this probably adds little to no utility for those outside the development community but could prove useful or "fun-to-use" for those _inside_ the development community whom spend a lot of time within development environments such as their terminal.

I'll be starting with a web-based version of this to quickly scaffold a minimum viable product. After that, I plan on rolling out a native cross-platform version, initially adding support for WhatsApp. I do also plan on adding other social media applications which would be determined depending on factors such as demand and API availability.

Another last thing I'd like to stress is that I aim to make Terminal Talk completely privacy-respecting. Terminal Talk would be self-hosted on your own machine and simply only forwards the messages you type without ever routing data through any external servers.
